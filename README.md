## About This Course

**Course Provider:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
**Focus:** Building modern, serverless backend applications using Python on AWS.

### Course Overview
In today's cloud-native application development, the emphasis is on building scalable, highly available, and fully managed serverless architectures. This approach reduces operational overhead, allowing you to focus more on your applications and business-specific projects that set you apart in the marketplace.

This course will guide you through the process of building a modern, greenfield serverless backend on AWS using Python. We will explore various AWS services, including:

- **Amazon API Gateway**: For serverless API hosting.
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless computing.
- **Amazon Cognito**: For serverless authentication.

### Key Concepts and Learning Outcomes
1. **API-Driven Development**: Learn to mock and design your API before implementation, and explore the extensive features of Amazon API Gateway beyond just API hosting.
2. **Serverless Authentication**: Understand how to integrate Amazon Cognito for secure authentication and authorization flows within your APIs.
3. **Lambda Backend**: Discover how to create and manage AWS Lambda functions for data processing tasks, and understand the various configurations available for optimizing performance.
4. **Serverless Workflows**: Implement complex workflows using AWS Step Functions, enabling multiple Lambda functions to work in a specified sequence.
5. **Optimization**: Learn how to optimize your APIs at every layer using AWS features to ensure efficiency and performance.

### Course Versions
This course is specifically tailored for Python developers. However, similar courses are available for other programming languages:

- **Node.js**: Building Modern Node.js Applications on AWS: Coursera
- **Java**: Building Modern Java Applications on AWS: Coursera
- **.NET**: Building Modern .NET Applications on AWS: Coursera

While there is considerable overlap among these courses, it's recommended to choose the course that aligns with the SDK you plan to use for AWS Cloud-based application development.

### Prerequisites
Before taking this course, you should have a basic understanding of AWS, including:

- AWS Global Infrastructure: Regions and Availability Zones.
- AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for controlling access to AWS resources.
- Basic AWS services like Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, and VPCs.
